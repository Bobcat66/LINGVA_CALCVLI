.mcs file format documentation

the .mcs file format is a binary file format made up of bytes
There are four metadata values at the head of the file: heap length, symbol length, var length, code length
Each metadata value is an unsigned 32-bit integer

HEAPS
each object in the heap is preceded by 4 bytes specifiying length,
one byte specifiying the width of each element, 
and one byte representing a boolean that determines whether the elements are signed

SYMBOLS
each symbol has one byte specifying its type, followed by 4 bytes which represent a 32-bit signed integer

LOCAL VARIABLES
Each variable consists of 4 bytes that represent a 32-bit signed integer

CODE
each opcode is a single byte wide
